/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * You are given an array of non-negative integers. Group the numbers such that each group contains numbers that are permutations of each otherâ€™s digits after removing all zeroes.
 *
 * Two numbers belong to the same group if their non-zero digits, when sorted, are equal.
 *
 * Zeros should be ignored when comparing digits (e.g., 011 is treated as 11).
 *
 * The solution should be as efficient as possible in terms of time and memory.
